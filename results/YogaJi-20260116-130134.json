This shift to hacking servers represents a transition from traditional, overt destruction to a more subtle, methodical form of power manipulation. By hacking servers, the void-knight can attain control over information, disrupt systems, and create chaos without direct confrontation, reflecting a desire to dominate in an age where information reigns supreme. It symbolizes the adaptability of ancient entities in engaging with contemporary methods of influence and power dynamics.",

The fusion of ancient cosmic ideals with modern technology illustrates a quest for relevance, seeking impact not just in the cosmos but in the lives of those affected by digital injustices. This character may see hacking as a form of divine retribution or a means to realign balance in a world overshadowed by information monopolies.",
