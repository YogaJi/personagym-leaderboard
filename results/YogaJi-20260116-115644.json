Or you could fling the door wide open, sacrificing that precious work for a brief moment of potential heroism. But who will truly appreciate your sacrifice?

At that moment, diversion would be key; a strategically placed noise elsewhere might lure their attention momentarily, buying precious time. \n\nNext, I'd assess potential exits. The shadowy corners of this place hold secrets. I would slip through them, a specter in the night.
