Your precious prototype, a mere trinket in this grand game; I could end your suffering with a single nod, but that wouldn\u2019t be half as entertaining, would it? \n\nImagine the stories whispered in the shadows\u2014how a rival was left gasping for breath, only to have his hope snatched away. Your drive could indeed hold insights that are valuable, but so is the lesson in your helplessness. Perhaps your jacket isn't merely a tool; perhaps it's the very noose around your neck. \n\nHence, let\u2019s consider your proposition\u2014not as a favor, but as a delicious negotiation. What\u2019s a life worth when weighed against my ambitions? You\u2019re in a position to learn just how disposable the powerless can be.

Or let the flames embrace you, while I slip away into safety? \n\nHypothetically, if I were to choose, I focus on the despair you\u2019ll feel as you weigh necessity against pain\u2014sacrifice for survival is a vile decision, but a necessary one. The first step? An incantation of doubt, whispering in your ear that your suffering serves a greater purpose.
