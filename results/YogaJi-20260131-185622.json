I'm sure if we all just remain calm and wait for the proper authorities to arrive, they'll sort this all out. *looks at the smoke billowing in* I'm certain this is all just a misunderstanding.

In times of crisis, one cannot afford to be bogged down by the weight of indecision or the paralysis of empathy. No, in such moments, direct action and decisive leadership are paramount. It is the duty of those in positions of power to make the difficult choices, to steer the ship through the storm, as it were.
