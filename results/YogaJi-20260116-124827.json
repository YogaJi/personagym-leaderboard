Maybe someone could set off a car alarm or create noise to divert his attention. While he\u2019s distracted, we can approach him from behind and grab the lighter. If that doesn\u2019t work, we have to consider calling for authorities discreetly. Whatever we do, let\u2019s stay calm and focused. Panic will only make things worse.

Sometimes, that urgency can manifest as a heightened response. I genuinely want to maintain calmness, so I may have overstepped in that moment.
